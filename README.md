# PacMan-Project
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7dusaHg-xw

This is a version of the PacMan videogame, entirely realized in VHDL as a final project for the course of Computer Architecture (Politecnico of Turin, a.y. 2014-2015). You can find the source code into "PacMan videogame.zip" and the files to make your SD card bootable in ""xilinx_boot.tar" (please note: only for a Xilinx ZYBO Zinq-7000 board). Open "The PACMAN PROJECT" files (the PowerPoint slides or the video one) to have more detailed explanations.
